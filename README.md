Password tester made using:

  * Java
  
  * JavaFX
  
  * REGEX
 
 ### Interface:
 ![Screenshot of program](https://github.com/Vinicius-92/passwordTester-gui/blob/main/src/gui/ScreenShot.png?raw=true)
 
 ### How it works:
 It's a basic program that only checks if the password follow the rules:
 
 * Minimal of 8 characters
 
 * Has at least one special character
 
 * Has at least one number
 
 * Needs to have a upper case letter too
 
 * Can't contain user's name
 
 * Can't be the same as old password
 
While making this simple program I was able to understando more basic concepts such as REGEX, Alerts and Stage Buiding in JavaFX
 
 ### How to use:
 
 On the root repository it is includeded the Runnable JAR File, you can download or clone the project and run with that file (PasswordTester.jar) or using Eclipse IDE with JafaFX and JDK installed.
